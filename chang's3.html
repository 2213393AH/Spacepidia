        <p>At the climax of a landmark mission, China's Chang'e 5 robotic lunar probe has started gathering lunar rocks
            and soil after landing on the moon late on Tuesday night.</p>

        <p>Chang'e 3 is expected to work for about two days in a region to the north of Mons Ruemker, a mountain
            overlooking a vast lunar mare called Oceanus Procellarum, or the Ocean of Storms, on the western edge of the
            moon's near side. After the surface operations are completed, it will bring about 2 kilograms of lunar
            samples back to Earth in mid-December, 44 years after the last substances from the moon were returned to
            Earth, according to the China National Space Administration.</p>
        <p>As the landing procedures began as scheduled at 10:57 pm, the lander-ascender combination of the 8.2-metric
            ton Chang'e 5 started its 7,500-newton-thrust engine to reduce its flying speed and began to descend toward
            the moon from about 15 kilometers above the lunar surface.</p>
        <p>As the landing procedures began as scheduled at 10:57 pm, the lander-ascender combination of the 8.2-metric
            ton Chang'e 5 started its 7,500-newton-thrust engine to reduce its flying speed and began to descend toward
            the moon from about 15 kilometers above the lunar surface.</p>
        <p>During the engine-assisted process, cameras on the lander-ascender took pictures of the landing site and
            transmitted them to computers to identify possible hazards on the surface such as large rocks so the craft
            could maneuver to avoid them.</p>
        <p>In January 2004, China's lunar orbiter project was formally established.The first Chinese lunar orbiter,
            Chang'e 1, was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center on 24 October 2007 and entered lunar orbit on 5
            November.The spacecraft operated until 1 March 2009, when it was intentionally crashed into the surface of
            the Moon.Data gathered by Chang'e 1 were used to create an accurate and high-resolution 3D map of the entire
            lunar surface, assisting site selection for the Chang'e 3 lander.</p>
        <p>The official mission objective is to achieve China's first soft-landing and roving exploration on the Moon,
            as well as to demonstrate and develop key technologies for future missions.The scientific objectives of
            Chang'e 3 include lunar surface topography and geology survey, lunar surface material composition and
            resource survey, Sun-Earth-Moon space environment detection, and lunar-based astronomical observation.
            Chang'e 3 will attempt to perform the first direct measurement of the structure and depth of the lunar soil
            down to a depth of 30 m (98 ft), and investigate the lunar crust structure down to several hundred meters
            deep.</p>
            <p>Chang'e 3 entered a 100 km (62 mi)-high circular lunar orbit on 6 December 2013, 9:53 UTC. The orbit was obtained after 361 seconds (6 minutes) of variable thrust engine braking from its single main engine.Later, the spacecraft adopted a 15 km (9.3 mi) Ã— 100 km (62 mi) elliptic orbit. The landing took place one week later, on 14 December. At periapsis, its variable thrusters were again fired in order to reduce its velocity, descending to 100 m (330 ft) above the Moon's surface. It hovered at this altitude, moving horizontally under its own guidance to avoid obstacles, before slowly descending to 4 m (13 ft) above the ground, at which point its engine was shut down for a free-fall onto the lunar surface. The landing sequence took about 12 minutes to complete.</p>
