        <p>At the climax of a landmark mission, China's Chang'e 5 robotic lunar probe has started gathering lunar rocks
            and soil after landing on the moon late on Tuesday night.</p>

        <p>Chang'e 5 is expected to work for about two days in a region to the north of Mons Ruemker, a mountain
            overlooking a vast lunar mare called Oceanus Procellarum, or the Ocean of Storms, on the western edge of the
            moon's near side. After the surface operations are completed, it will bring about 2 kilograms of lunar
            samples back to Earth in mid-December, 44 years after the last substances from the moon were returned to
            Earth, according to the China National Space Administration.</p>
        <p>As the landing procedures began as scheduled at 10:57 pm, the lander-ascender combination of the 8.2-metric
            ton Chang'e 5 started its 7,500-newton-thrust engine to reduce its flying speed and began to descend toward
            the moon from about 15 kilometers above the lunar surface.</p>

        <p>During the engine-assisted process, cameras on the lander-ascender took pictures of the landing site and
            transmitted them to computers to identify possible hazards on the surface such as large rocks so the craft
            could maneuver to avoid them.</p>
