        <p>The Chinese Manned Space Agency (CMSA) built Tiangong — which means "Heavenly Palace" — in low Earth orbit, launching each of the three modules that make up the station between 2021 and 2022. The CMSA launched Tianhe, the first station module, on April 28, 2021, the second module Wentian on July 24, 2022, and the third module Mengtian on Oct. 31, 2022. </p>
        <p>As the landing procedures began as scheduled at 10:57 pm, the lander-ascender combination of the 8.2-metric ton Chang'e 5 started its 7,500-newton-thrust engine to reduce its flying speed and began to descend toward the moon from about 15 kilometers above the lunar surface.</p>

        <p>During the engine-assisted process, cameras on the lander-ascender took pictures of the landing site and transmitted them to computers to identify possible hazards on the surface such as large rocks so the craft could maneuver to avoid them.</p>
